let taurus = "You may feel restless today. Or maybe it's your friends and family members who are restless. Though you might need them now, they may not be available. But that's not such a bad thing, is it? Seek out an adventurous new experience of your own. Don't get hung up on wishing for greater closeness or more contact with others. Find a solo adventure. Have fun being your own, interesting self.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"


let gemini = "The world is your oyster today. So what are you waiting for? Get out there and find your adventure. It's a perfect day for learning something new. This can be formalized through taking a class, or it can be an informal, impromptu process. That's what 'the world is your oyster' means -- your pearl of knowledge is out there, just waiting to be discovered. So where will you search for it first?(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

let cancer = "Lots of people are in a freewheeling, experimental mood today. They're letting their minds roam. But you might easily react against their philosophies and actually narrow your own thinking. That's not a good thing! Broad-ranging ideas are favored now. If a new concept makes you uncomfortable, that's an indication that you should explore it further. Make the unfamiliar become familiar. That should be your goal.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

let leo = "Life could get really interesting today. At the very least, you're likely to read or hear something that captures your attention and fascinates you.

As long as you're brave enough to chase down the people, places and subjects that intrigue you, you're taking advantage of today's influence in exactly the right way.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

let virgo = "Rigid, narrow thinking has no place in your life today. If you try to stick to a strict routine, you'll find yourself challenged to break out of it at every turn. And if you try to use traditional methods in what you do, you'll find yourself confronted by ideas that may seem radical. Embrace these ideas! They're worth exploring -- if only to prove their value in whatever you're trying to do.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

let libra = "You feel the urge today to expand your horizons. This might happen through talking to people as you move through your daily business.

So find a person or a subject that intrigues you, and dive into it.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

let scorpio = "You're always looking deeply inward, whether into your own thoughts and feelings or someone else's. Today, turn your focus outward. Get broadminded, lighthearted and optimistic. It's time to lighten your mental load, if only for a day. Movies and novels are a great escape now, because they transport you to another time and place. And ultimately, they still give you insight and help you understand human nature better.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

let sagittarius = "Your theme, motto and goal today should be 'outward bound' -- in any way that applies. Get out of the house, first and foremost. If possible, hit the road. Explore a new neighborhood, or better yet, a new town. If you can't do that, explore the world virtually through reading or watching films. And above all, let your mind wander. Entertain new ideas. Develop new theories. Make mental connections between seemingly unrelated elements.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

let capricorn = "Instead of digging into your work or following your usual routine today, why not check out some unfamiliar surroundings? Take an adventure, whether a physical or a mental one. Explore new theories or visit a new area of town. You can also satisfy your yen for fresh experiences by trying a restaurant you've never visited before, or signing up for a class in a subject that's brand-new to you.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com"

let aquarius = "Your independent streak is a mile wide today. If someone tries to tell you how to think, you'll resist! You want to chart your own course. If there's a new idea or theory to discover, you'll find it on your own. Of course, you're savvy enough to recognize a good teacher when you see one. If someone offers you advice or other insight, take it for what it's worth.(c) Kelli Fox, The Astrologer, http://new.theastrologer.com";

let pisces = "Today, fascinating realms beckon to you, offering exciting adventures. New ideas seem incredible and compelling. New subjects beg you to dig in and learn. The only problem with all this? You're even more gullible today than usual. Something that seems too good to be true probably is -- but you'll have a hard time seeing that now.
